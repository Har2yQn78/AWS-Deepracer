AWS DeepRacer Project
Introduction
This project documents my journey with AWS DeepRacer, highlighting the progression and tuning of various models. The aim was to improve lap times and overall performance by experimenting with different reward functions and hyperparameters.

Model Development Journey
Initial Models
The first few models I built were quite solid but had limited parameters. These models showed stable performance but lacked the necessary reward structure to encourage faster speeds. The limited parameters restricted the model's ability to optimize for higher speeds, resulting in moderate lap times.

Intermediate Models
To address the shortcomings of the initial models, I introduced additional parameters and fine-tuned the reward function. These changes led to a significant improvement in performance. The models became more adaptive, resulting in better lap times while maintaining low step counts. The balance between exploration and exploitation in the reward function helped the models learn more efficient paths on the track.

Final Model
Encouraged by the success of the intermediate models, I decided to experiment with a more complex model featuring a larger number of parameters. However, this complexity proved to be a double-edged sword. The model struggled to converge and required extensive training. The increased parameter count introduced more variables that the model needed to learn, leading to difficulties in optimizing the reward function effectively.

Conclusion
Through this journey, I learned the importance of balancing model complexity with the ability to generalize and perform well. While more parameters can provide greater flexibility, they also demand careful tuning and more training time. The intermediate models struck a good balance, showing that sometimes, simplicity combined with thoughtful tuning can outperform more complex setups.

Future Work
Moving forward, I plan to:

Experiment with different reward functions to further optimize performance.
Test additional hyperparameters to find the optimal balance for training efficiency.
Explore new techniques and strategies shared by the DeepRacer community.
